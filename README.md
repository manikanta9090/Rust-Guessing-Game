# Guessing Game

A simple number guessing game built using Rust, inspired by the official Rust Book tutorial.

## 📌 Description

This project generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
The user is prompted to enter a guess, and the program responds with:

- **Too small!**
- **Too big!**
- **You win!**

The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
